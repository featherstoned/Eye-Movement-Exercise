# Eye Movement Exercise
#### Portfolio Ready | MIT Full Stack Course Week 8

#### Description: 
The JavaScript creates an interactive effect on the web page where two eyes follow the cursor's movement in the browser window. The CSS provides the color and structure to the page.

##### How To Run: 
Fork and clone repo to your local machine. Open "index.html" file to load page to your browser.

##### Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
I plan to link Google Fonts to add a more interesting font. I plan to also add some kind of face background to the eyes to create visual interest.
